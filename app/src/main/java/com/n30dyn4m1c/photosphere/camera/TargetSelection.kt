 * Which target the reticle is working on, when targets may be shot in any order.

 * doubles back — and by default the active target follows it. But like Street
 * View, any marker can be shot: aim squarely at a different uncaptured dot and
 * it becomes the active target. That is what lets a user fill a gap they can
 * see, dodge a person walking through the next frame, or simply shoot the
 * sphere in whatever order their feet prefer, without the app insisting on its
 * own sequence.
 *
 * Pure: the capture loop hands in the attitude and the captured set, so the
 * rules are unit-testable without a device.
